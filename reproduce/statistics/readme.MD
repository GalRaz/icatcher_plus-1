# Statistics on videos and participants

This folder contains R markdown notebooks and corresponding html reports.

01_Generate_Split - Generates the train/validate/test split and compares distributions (numerically & visually) of participant age, gender and race

02_Move-files-for-QI - Moves files from original Lookit folders to populate video and annotation folders. Also checks for number of files.

03_Metrics_Analysis - Creates supplemental figures and analyses using lasso regression over trial-by-trial human-model agreement. **Note**: The data required to reproduce this analysis is not openly available, because it links looking behavior of individual participants to demographic data.
